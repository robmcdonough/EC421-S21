# EC421-Spring 2021 Discussion Sections

Welcome to the github page for my discussion sections of Economics 421: Introduction to Econometrics (taught by [Connor Lennon](https://economics.uoregon.edu/profile/clennon/)).

I will primarily be using this page to make post the code from our weekly discussion sections, which you can find below. 

In general, you can expect that each week's code will be made available on Wednesday or Thursday.
